### Key Features of the Script:
1. **Scan Folder**: List all image files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) in the scriptâ€™s directory.
2. **User Selection**: Prompt the user to select an image from the list.
3. **Decode Pixel Values**: Extract RGB pixel values and convert them to hex and binary.
4. **Search for Words**: Grep meaningful words (e.g., ASCII strings) in the hex representation of the image file.
5. **Steganography Analysis**:
   - Check for hidden messages in pixel values (e.g., LSB - Least Significant Bit analysis).
   - Check for hidden images by analyzing pixel patterns or anomalies.
6. **Recolor Proposition**: Modify pixel values (e.g., amplify LSB differences) to reveal potential hidden messages and save the modified image.
7. **Save Results**: Store hex, binary, found words, and modified images in a `results` subfolder.
8. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Handle large images efficiently (process a subset of pixels if needed).
   - Support common image formats.
   - Provide clear output for analysis.


### Script Implementation


### Explanation of the Script:
1. **Folder Scanning**: Uses `pathlib` to list files with extensions `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.gif`.
2. **User Selection**: Displays numbered list of images and prompts for selection.
3. **Pixel Decoding**: Uses `Pillow` and `numpy` to extract RGB values, converts to hex and binary, saves to `results/<image>_pixels.txt`.
4. **Word Search**: Reads raw file bytes, converts to hex, uses regex to find ASCII strings (4+ characters), saves to `results/<image>_words.txt`.
5. **Steganography Analysis**:
   - **LSB Check**: Extracts least significant bits from red channel, attempts to decode as ASCII, saves to `results/<image>_lsb.txt`.
   - **Hidden Image Check**: Analyzes pixel differences for anomalies, saves to `results/<image>_anomaly.txt`.
6. **Recolor Proposition**: Amplifies LSB in red channel (sets to 255 if LSB=1, else 0) to reveal hidden patterns, saves as `results/<image>_recolored.png`.
7. **Results Storage**: All outputs (hex, binary, words, analysis, recolored image) are saved in the `results` subfolder.

### Additional Needs:
- **Libraries**: Install `Pillow` (`pip install Pillow`) and `numpy` (`pip install numpy`).
- **Performance**: For large images, the script processes a subset of pixels to avoid memory issues. Adjust limits (e.g., `min(10, height)` or `[:1000]`) for full processing if needed.
- **Steganography Detection**: LSB is a basic method; advanced steganography (e.g., frequency domain) may require additional libraries like `stegano`.
- **Error Handling**: The script assumes valid image files. Add checks for corrupted files if needed.
- **Security**: Be cautious with untrusted images, as they may contain malicious data.
